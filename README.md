Quick Kitchen Vision statement
==============================
 
Quick Kitchen will be used to help people find recipes which they can prepare. It will allow users to search based on their needs and provide customised results.
 
The primary users for this mobile application will be students, working class people or people who do not get proper time to prepare nutritious meals and mostly rely on fast foods. The application will allow the users to search recipes based on their available ingredients at home and duration to prepare the meal. All available recipes will have proper nutrition information available with the recipe so the user can get the required nutrition they need and will be healthier than fast food or processed food.
 
People who keep track of their calorie intakes, housewives and hobbyist cooks will also be able to use this application. There will be a feature where the user can search recipes based on total calorie on the meal which allows them to keep track of their calorie consumption. Users will also be able to search direct recipes by name or based on occasions (e.g., thanksgiving, birthday party).
 
The application will be easy and simple to use. As mentioned, it will have multiple search customizable options. However, a user does not need to use all of them. Every person has different needs. A user will be able to use as minimum as one option and the application will be able to find a proper recipe based on the users need.
 
Getting required calories a day and getting proper nutritious food are not the same thing. There are still people who are suffering from malnutrition. A vast majority of working-class people and students are relying on fast-food chains and processed food for their daily meals. Having these foods once or twice will not hurt anything but having these every day can bring major health issues like heart diseases, obesity, high blood pressure etc. This application is a step towards improving this situation. Many people do not know how quickly a meal can be prepared with their available ingredients. Also making a meal does not have to be difficult. This application will allow the users to get quick recipes which will be both less time consuming and nutritious than processed foods. Apart from this, the application can be a great resource for people who want to learn and try new recipes. Its customizable search feature will allow users to find unique and delicious recipes with proper instructions to prepare.
 
The application is primarily planned to launch as an android mobile application. However, in future versions it will also support iOS and web interface.

This Quick Kitchen application will be considered successful if the survey report says users who uses recipe app frequently gets their desired food recipe with 40% less clicks than other similar applications. In addition, if 50% of random user who may or may not have previous experience using similar application can find their desired recipe at least 60% faster than other recipe applications.
