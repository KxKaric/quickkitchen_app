            Quick Kitchen will be used to help people find recipes which they
            can prepare. It will allow users to search based on their needs and
            provide customised results.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary users for this mobile application will be students,
            working class people or people who do not get proper time to prepare
            nutritious meals and mostly rely on fast foods. The application will
            allow the users to search recipes based on their available
            ingredients at home and duration to prepare the meal. All available
            recipes will have proper nutrition information available with the
            recipe so the user can get the required nutrition they need and will
            be healthier than fast food or processed food.
          </p>
          <p>
            People who keep track of their calorie intakes, housewives and
            hobbyist cooks will also be able to use this application. There will
            be a feature where the user can search recipes based on total
            calorie on the meal which allows them to keep track of their calorie
            consumption. Users will also be able to search direct recipes by
            name or based on occasions (e.g., thanksgiving, birthday party).
          </p>
          <p>
            The application will be easy and simple to use. As mentioned, it
            will have multiple search customizable options. However, a user does
            not need to use all of them. Every person has different needs. A
            user will be able to use as minimum as one option and the
            application will be able to find a proper recipe based on the users
            need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Getting required calories a day and getting proper nutritious food
            are not the same thing. There are still people who are suffering
            from malnutrition. A vast majority of working-class people and
            students are relying on fast-food chains and processed food for
            their daily meals. Having these foods once or twice will not hurt
            anything but having these every day can bring major health issues
            like heart diseases, obesity, high blood pressure etc. This
            application is a step towards improving this situation. Many people
            do not know how quickly a meal can be prepared with their available
            ingredients. Also making a meal does not have to be difficult. This
            application will allow the users to get quick recipes which will be
            both less time consuming and nutritious than processed foods. Apart
            from this, the application can be a great resource for people who
            want to learn and try new recipes. Its customizable search feature
            will allow users to find unique and delicious recipes with proper
            instructions to prepare.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application is primarily planned to launch as an android mobile
            application. However, in future versions it will also support iOS
            and web interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Quick Kitchen application will be considered as a successful
            project if people who are currently relying on processed food as
            their daily meal start to use this application to prepare home-made
            nutritious meals as a replacement of processed food and other users
            use it as their cooking resource. Another significant criteria is,
            this project will be able to reduce the monthly expenses on foods by
            reducing the rate of eating out.
